# Truth Table Generator

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this little VB.NET project. This code generates a **truth table** in a CSV file for a specific logic scenario. Let me break it down for you in plain English.

## What Does This Code Do?

1. **Input Labels**: The code starts by defining some input labels: `A0`, `A1`, `A2`, `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, `C0`, `C1`, `C2`. These represent 9 binary inputs (basically, 9 switches that can be either 0 or 1).

2. **Truth Table Rows**: It calculates the total number of rows needed for the truth table. Since each input can be either 0 or 1, the total number of rows is `2^9` (which is 512). That's a lot of combinations! ðŸ˜…

3. **CSV Content**: It creates a CSV file where each row represents a unique combination of the inputs and the corresponding output `Q`. The output `Q` is calculated based on a simple rule:
   - If all three groups (`A`, `B`, and `C`) are **identical**, then `Q = 1`.
   - Otherwise, `Q = 0`.

4. **File Generation**: The code writes all these combinations into a CSV file named `truth_table.csv` and saves it to your computer.

5. **Console Message**: Once the file is generated, it prints a message to the console saying, "Truth table CSV generated: truth_table.csv". You can check the file in your project folder.

## How Does It Work?

- The code loops through all possible combinations of the 9 inputs (from `000000000` to `111111111` in binary).
- For each combination, it checks if the groups `A`, `B`, and `C` are the same.
- If they are, `Q` is set to `1`; otherwise, it's `0`.
- Finally, it writes all this data into a CSV file.

## Example Output

Hereâ€™s what the CSV file might look like:

```
A0,A1,A2,B0,B1,B2,C0,C1,C2,Q
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
...
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
```

## How to Run This Code

1. Make sure you have a VB.NET environment set up (like Visual Studio).
2. Copy and paste the code into a new VB.NET console project.
3. Run the program.
4. Check your project folder (debug folder) for the `truth_table.csv` file.

## Why Is This Useful?

This kind of truth table is often used in digital logic design, testing, or even just for fun to understand how different inputs affect the output. Itâ€™s a neat way to visualize all possible scenarios for a given logic condition.


Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
